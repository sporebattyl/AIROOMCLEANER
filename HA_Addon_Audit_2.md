# Home Assistant Addon Audit Report - Cycle 2

## 1. Failure Analysis

The previous build cycle failed during container startup. The runtime log showed the following critical error:

```
/run/s6/basedir/scripts/rc.init: 76: /run.sh: not found
```

This error indicates that the `s6-overlay` init system, which manages the container's lifecycle, could not find the main execution script at the expected path `/run.sh`.

### Root Cause Analysis

A review of the `ai_room_cleaner/Dockerfile` revealed the following issues:

1.  **Incorrect File Location:** The `WORKDIR` is set to `/app`. Subsequently, the instruction `COPY --chown=app:app . .` copies the entire build context, including `run.sh`, into the `/app` directory. This results in the script being placed at `/app/run.sh` instead of the required `/run.sh`.
2.  **Missing Execute Permissions:** The `Dockerfile` does not include a command to grant execute permissions to the `run.sh` script after copying it. Even if the path were correct, the container would fail because the script is not executable.

## 2. Remediation Plan

To resolve the runtime failure, the `Dockerfile` must be modified to place the `run.sh` script in the correct location and set the appropriate permissions. The most direct way to achieve this is by adding specific `COPY` and `RUN` instructions for the `run.sh` file *before* the application files are copied.

### Checklist of Required Changes

-   [ ] **Modify `Dockerfile`:** Add a `COPY` instruction to place `run.sh` at the root (`/`) of the container's filesystem.
-   [ ] **Modify `Dockerfile`:** Add a `RUN` instruction immediately after the new `COPY` command to grant execute permissions (`chmod a+x`) to `/run.sh`.
-   [ ] **Modify `Dockerfile`:** Adjust the application file `COPY` instruction to prevent it from overwriting or conflicting with the correctly placed `run.sh`.
