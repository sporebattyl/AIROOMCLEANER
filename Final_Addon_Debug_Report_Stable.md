# Final Addon Debug Report: AI Room Cleaner (Stable)

This report summarizes the debugging process for the "AI Room Cleaner" Home Assistant addon, from initial audit to final stable build.

## 1. Initial State and Audit Findings

The initial version of the addon underwent several automated and manual audits, which identified a range of issues:

*   **Dockerfile:** The base image was not pinned to a specific version, and `pip` commands were not using the `--no-cache-dir` flag.
*   **`run.sh` Script:** The script contained Windows-style line endings (CRLF) and used a non-standard shebang.
*   **`config.yaml`:** The configuration file had an indentation error and an incorrect schema for the `log_level` option.
*   **Python Source Code:** The code included a deprecated FastAPI event handler and an incorrect service call to `todo.remove_item`.

## 2. The "Base Image Not Found" Error

The most critical issue encountered was a recurring build failure due to the error: "The base image is not found." This error persisted through multiple debug cycles and was caused by an incorrect reference to the base image in the `build.json` and `Dockerfile`.

The team iteratively attempted to resolve this by:

1.  Pinning the base image to a specific version digest.
2.  Switching to a different base image (`homeassistant/base:2023.10.0`).
3.  Using a more specific Python base image (`python:3.9-slim-buster`).

None of these changes resolved the build failure in the Home Assistant environment.

## 3. Breakthrough and Resolution

The breakthrough occurred when the build configuration was updated to use the `ghcr.io/home-assistant/amd64-base-python:latest` image. While using a `:latest` tag is generally not recommended best practice, it was the only configuration that the Home Assistant build system would accept.

This discovery highlighted a key learning: the Home Assistant build environment has specific requirements that can override general Docker best practices.

## 4. Final Fixes and Validation

With the build system finally operational, the remaining issues from the audit reports were addressed:

*   The `run.sh` script's line endings were converted to Unix-style (LF).
*   The `log_level` schema in `config.yaml` was corrected.
*   The `todo.remove_item` service call was fixed to correctly clear the to-do list.

After these fixes were applied, the addon was successfully built, deployed, and validated in a Home Assistant environment. The final runtime validation confirmed that the addon is stable and fully functional.
