# Home Assistant Addon Guardian Audit Report (Cycle 5)

**Addon:** `ai_room_cleaner`
**Date:** 2025-06-19

## 1. Dockerfile Analysis

The `hadolint` scan of `ai_room_cleaner/Dockerfile` revealed the following:

*   **DL3006 warning:** `Always tag the version of an image explicitly`
    *   **File:** `ai_room_cleaner/Dockerfile:3`
    *   **Recommendation:** The base images in `build.json` should use specific version tags instead of `latest` to ensure reproducible builds. For example, `ghcr.io/home-assistant/amd64-base-python:3.11`.

## 2. Shell Script Analysis

The `shellcheck` analysis of `ai_room_cleaner/run.sh` reported multiple instances of `SC1017 (error): Literal carriage return`.

*   **File:** `ai_room_cleaner/run.sh`
*   **Recommendation:** The script contains Windows-style line endings (CRLF). It should be converted to Unix-style line endings (LF) to prevent execution errors in the container. This can be fixed by running `tr -d '\r' < ai_room_cleaner/run.sh > ai_room_cleaner/run.sh.new && mv ai_room_cleaner/run.sh.new ai_room_cleaner/run.sh`.

## 3. Configuration Review

### `config.yaml`

The configuration file is well-structured and defines the necessary options for the addon. The schema validation rules are correctly defined.

### `build.json`

The `build.json` file specifies the base images for different architectures. However, it uses the `latest` tag for the `amd64` architecture, which is not recommended.

*   **Recommendation:** Pin the `amd64` base image to a specific version to ensure build consistency.

## 4. Source Code Review

The Python source code in `ai_room_cleaner/app/` is organized into services for handling Home Assistant, AI, and camera interactions.

*   **`main.py`**: The main application file sets up a FastAPI server and a background task for analyzing the room. The task loop includes error handling.
*   **`ha_service.py`**: This service encapsulates all interactions with the Home Assistant API, which is a good practice.
*   **`ai_service.py`**: This service handles the communication with the AI provider. The parsing of the AI response is currently a placeholder and will need to be implemented based on the actual AI provider's output.

## Summary of Findings

The static code audit identified a few issues that should be addressed:

1.  **Dockerfile:** The use of the `latest` tag for a base image should be replaced with a specific version tag.
2.  **Shell Script:** The `run.sh` script has incorrect line endings and needs to be converted to Unix format.
3.  **Configuration:** The `build.json` file should be updated to use a specific version for the `amd64` base image.
4.  **Source Code:** The AI response parsing in `ai_service.py` is a placeholder and needs a proper implementation.

Overall, the addon is well-structured, but the identified issues should be remediated to improve its stability and maintainability.
